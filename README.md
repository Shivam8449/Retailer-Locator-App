📍 Retailer Locator App

A mobile-friendly, real-time React application to browse and discover nearby retailers. The app supports location-based sorting, category filtering, retailer search, and instant WhatsApp contact integration — all designed to enhance local shopping experiences.

🌟 Features

🔍 Search Retailers
Easily search for retailers by their name using the search bar at the top of the list.

📂 Category Filter
Filter retailers based on their categories (e.g. Grocery, Electronics, Fashion, etc.) to quickly find relevant shops.

📌 Geolocation-based Sorting
Automatically detects your current location (with permission) and displays retailers closest to you first, enhancing local discovery.

🛍️ Retailer Cards
Each retailer is displayed as a clean, modern card containing:

Retailer Name
Category
Distance from your location
Contact via WhatsApp button (opens a WhatsApp chat window with the retailer)
📱 Mobile-first Responsive Design
The app is fully optimized for mobile devices and works seamlessly across tablets and desktops as well.

📦 Local JSON Data Source
Retailer data is fetched from a local data.json file for rapid access and easy customization.
